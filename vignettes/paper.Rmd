## Summary

The objective of the [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) project is to provide the research community with a unified data hub by collecting worldwide fine-grained case data merged with demographics, air pollution, and other exogenous variables helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19. This is achieved via the [R package COVID19](https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19). 

## R Package COVID19

COVID19 is a simple yet effective R package designed to collect tidy-format datasets of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. Raw data are retrieved in real-time, cleaned, and matched with exogenous variables. Vintage databases are also supported.
